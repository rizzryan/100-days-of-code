## Cryptocurrency
This is a simple cryptocurrency monitor. It is made in Python. The whole aim is to monitor for changes within each of the coins in terms of prices and availability.

## How I built it
I coded crypto in Python. To gather the data for the crypto currencies, I used the API from <a href="https://api.coinmarketcap.com/v1/ticker/">CoinMarketCap</a> to display the top 100 crypto currencies. I then parsed the JSON data to display the data of the coins. The parsed data ended up being the rank,symbol, name, and price of the virtual currency.

## How frequently does Crypto run?
I have deployed Crypto on a Heroku server that would serve the functionality of being able to run remotely.
